Use Jest testing framework

Structure tests with describe and it blocks

Test happy path, edge cases, and failure states

Mock all external API calls and dependencies

Use meaningful test descriptions

Follow AAA pattern: Arrange, Act, Assert

Keep tests isolated and independent

Use beforeEach/afterEach for setup and cleanup

Mock timers when testing time-dependent code

Test async operations with async/await

Use toThrow() for error testing

Prefer specific matchers over toBe(true/false)
